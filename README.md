# A Machine Learning model Python project

This project aims to test a homemade machine learning model, while also testing other predefined models from the scikit-learn library.

Part I creates a simple model based on the Logistic Regression algorithm.

Part II compares the performance of the SVC, KNeighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms, offering an insight on their efficiency, accuracy and speed.
